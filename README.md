# boostnote-notes - OFFICIALLY DISCONTINUED
class notes using Boostnote

Hi all (nobody is reading this, but that's fine). I love boostnote; however, seeing as I'm not in school anymore and I'm officially a ~~~~~developer~~~~~~ I've switched to notable because of .md support (I also like to edit in my code editor at times) and because it's "all the rage."
